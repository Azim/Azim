Well hello there!

I see you stumbled upon my Github profile.

I am a software engineer from Russia, mainly doing Java and C++ projects in my free time.

I also did that discord [scheduling bot](https://github.com/Azim/ZimmyScheduler) once, and now its gonna haunt me until the end of days as i cant bring myself to prevent the tiny userbase from using it.

  To maintain the bot or something, might as well leave it here:
